    <h2>How Does Accipio Key Work?</h2>

    <ol>
        <li>Runs in the background</li>
        <li>Listens for user input</li>
        <li>Analyzes input (identifies misspellings, typos, snippets)</li>
        <li>Takes appropriate action (correction, completion, generation)</li>
    </ol>

    <aside class="notes">
        Accipio Key does this by running in the background, listening for user keyboard input and providing text correction, completion, and generation across all applications in a standardized manner. This set of standardized features allow users to quickly and effortlessly navigate between applications and retain the word processing features they are accustomed to use.
