    <h2>What is Accipio Key?</h2>

    <ul>
        <li>Proof of concept</li>
        <li>Improves user typing experience</li>
        <li>Draws inspiration from current smartphone technologies</li>
    </ul>

    <aside class="notes">
        Accipio Key is a proof of concept assistive application which aims to help users type in an easier, faster and less frustrating way by utilizing full-text search technologies to normalize and streamline the typing experience on desktops. This project draws inspiration from current smartphone technologies and it tries to mimic the most useful features as best as possible.

    <h2>How Does Accipio Key Work?</h2>

    <ol>
        <li>Runs in the background</li>
        <li>Listens for user input</li>
        <li>Analyzes input (identifies misspellings, typos, snippets)</li>
        <li>Takes appropriate action (correction, completion, generation)</li>
    </ol>

    <aside class="notes">
        Accipio Key does this by running in the background, listening for user keyboard input and providing text correction, completion, and generation across all applications in a standardized manner. This set of standardized features allow users to quickly and effortlessly navigate between applications and retain the word processing features they are accustomed to use.

    <h2>System Diagram</h2>
    <img src="images/flowchart.png" alt="">

    <aside class="notes">
        Here is a basic system diagram of Accipio Key. When the application starts users can login with a username and password. Having multiple accounts on a computer allows for tailored output for the specific user. Once the application starts several event dispatchers are initialized in order to gather user input, process it and dispatch the events to other components of the application. Some of the core events processed are word events, correction events, completion events and many more. The application listens for these events and distributes them to event handlers which output the event result to the screen. Let's now look at each individual feature individually.

    <h2>Corrections</h2>

    <ul>
        <li>cansas -> kansas</li>
        <li>peopl -> people</li>
    </ul>

    <aside class="notes">
        First let's look at corrections. They are very simple to understand. Accipio Key keeps track of what you have typed and what you are currently typing. When you are done typing a word Accipio Key checks if the word was misspelled. If the word was misspelled it deletes the misspelled word and inputs the correction to the screen.

    <h2>Completions</h2>

    <ul>
        <li>ca -> (cat, car, castle, camp)</li>
        <li>ne -> (new, nest)</li>
    </ul>

    <aside class="notes">
        Completions are slightly different from corrections. Completions process the word which you are currently typing and try to complete the it. This feature requires the press of a shortcut combination to complete the word. Completions will not occur automatically, unless the user specifies.

    <h2>Generation</h2>

    <ul>
        <li>lol -> laugh out loud</li>
        <li>brb -> be right back</li>
    </ul>

    <aside class="notes">
        Generations are similar to completions in that they take the current word you are typing as input. But they differ from completions because there is no guessing on what the user is trying to type. The user defines short form words like 'lol' and 'brb' and assign them text to be generated when they type in the short form word and a keyboard combination.

    <h2>Underlying Technologies</h2>

    <ul>
        <li>Python 3</li>
        <li>Kivy (GUI)</li>
        <li>TextBlob</li>
        <li>Elasticsearch</li>
        <li>MongoDB</li>
    </ul>

    <aside class="notes">
        Before we get to the demo. Let me outline the underlying technologies used in this project. Python 3 was used as the general purpose programming language. Kivy was used for the Graphical user interface. TextBlob and Elasticsearch where used for text processing. Finally MongoDB was used to store user related information.
