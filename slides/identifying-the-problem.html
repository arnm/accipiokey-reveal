    <h3>Typing Is Not The Most Direct Way To Express Your Thoughts</h3>

    <ul>
        <li>Misspellings</li>
        <li>Typos</li>
    </ul>

    <aside class="notes">
        Typing is not the most direct way to express your thoughts. Because of our human nature we make mistakes and in the context of typing those mistakes usually manifest as misspellings and typos. So what can we do about these problems?

    <h2>Smartphones Have Assistive Keyboard Applications</h2>

    <ul>
        <li>Auto-correction</li>
        <li>Auto-completion</li>
        <li>Word-suggestion</li>
    </ul>

    <aside class="notes">
        Take a look at your smart phone. It has a keyboard application which auto-corrects your misspelled words and typos. The fancier keyboard apps even complete your words and insert correct punctuation. The fanciest keyboard apps suggest words to use next based on your previous input, meaning that it's context aware. If you're writing in the past tense word suggestion are also in the past tense. In addition to all these useful features all keyboard apps on smartphones work on every application on your device. The typing experience you had on one app is exactly the same as you have on another app. So what about Desktops?

    <h2>Desktops Have Not Standardized The Typing Experience</h2>

    <ul>
        <li>Individual applications may have assistive typing</li>
        <li>No guarantee your typing experience will be the same across applications</li>
    </ul>

    <aside class="notes">
        Desktops have fallen behind mobile devices when it comes to providing tools for more efficient typing experiences. Think of your typing experience in MS Word vs Notepad. It's a drastically different experience. MS Word provides some correction capabilities, sentence analysis, etc. Notepad on the other hand provides none of those features. The desktop environment needs a tool which will standardize the typing experience no matter if your browsing the web or jotting down some notes. Unfortunately I know of no tools on the desktop which provide this experience.
